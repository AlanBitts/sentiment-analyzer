# About
In this project, we make use of the embedded **Watson AI** libraries, to create an application that would perform sentiment analysis on a provided text. We then deploy the said application over the web using **Flask** framework.

[Embeddable Watson AI libraries](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/watson-libraries-embeddable-ai-that-works-for-you/) include the NLP library, the text-to-speech library and the speech-to-text library. These libraries can be embedded and distributed as part of your application.
